### About it

This program was made using `ava`, `Node.js` and `javascript`. You can search movies by tags, year, name and sort it. Also, you can add a movie to the list, the movies come from a `.json` file where it gets read and you can modified it.

However, the tests are not functioning at the moment because i need to update `ava` and it's configuration in the `package.json`, thank you for understanding.
